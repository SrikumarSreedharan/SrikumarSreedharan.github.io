<p><em>The spiritual retreat of eleven days from 18-28 June 2014 in South India covering Mayiladuthurai,<!--more--> Thiruvanamalai, Rameshwaram and Kutrallam organised by Divine Explorer and led by Guruji and Guruma, will always remain a memorable event in our lives, a special moment of grace for which we can only be ever grateful for the blessing. So much distance covered, so intensive the diverse experience, so inexplicable our unplanned auspicious timing, so privileged the opportunities opened to us to experience inner caves charged with the sanctified vibrations of the Masters and so exhilarating the showers of the spirit at the Kutrallam Waterfalls that words cannot adequately describe the special significance of this Karmakshalan Retreat. Thank you Divine Explorer !</em></p>
