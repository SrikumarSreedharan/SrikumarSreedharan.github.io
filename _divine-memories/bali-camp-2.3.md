<p><i>We all were immensely blessed in presence of </i><b><i>Guruji </i></b><i>&amp;</i><b><i> Guruma.</i></b></p><!--more-->
<p><b><i>BALI</i></b><i> !!! Ah what a place ! Beautiful and serene with full of  positive prana &amp; vibes. </i><i>Immense gratitude to our organiser Divine Explorer for choosing AYODHYA resort </i><i>for hosting the retreat. It was such a huge and lovely property,very appropriate for the camp. Very luxurious, </i><i>beautiful and the staff was very helpful,co-operative and kind.</i></p>
<p><i>Thanks to camp Ananda, organised by Divine Explorer, where our children were taken care of, by engaging them in various playful activities </i><i>by the hotel staff. Without this I think none of the moms would have been able to single mindedly attend Gurujis </i><i>lectures.</i></p>
<p><i>Guruma, immense gratitude for the wonderful mornings we experienced on the beach watching the beautiful sunrise </i><i>and moving to your rhythmic counts and movements of holistic exercises. which was followed by sun gazing and meditation.</i></p>
<p><i>The learning sessions were great. They happened in a very informal manner between breakfast, teatime &amp; lunch.</i></p>
<p><i>Guruji explained to us the 3 most important Lessons for which we keep coming on this earth plane.They are Health ,Relationship, </i><i>&amp; Money. All our lives revolve around these issues . He explained to us how important it is to learn our lessons to resolve </i><i>our issues related to these with understanding and awareness to walk the path of Jeevan Mukta.</i></p>
<p><i>The lessons on Prosperity and Why prosperity is so important for our liberation was so well explained and discussed </i><i>by Guruji &amp; Guruma. All the hippocracies about money &amp; money matters was shattered.</i></p>
<p><i>The lessons on Laws of Karma &amp; Karmashalan were amazing. A systematic learning approach with the right kind of </i><i> understanding will set us free from our karma malas was stressed upon. Water kriya and fire kriya was conducted and </i><i>all of us benefitted immensely.</i></p>
<p><i>Our meeting with the founder of the Ashram Gandhi Puri, </i><b><i>Bramhachari Indra Udayana ,</i></b><i>was really heart warming.</i></p>
<p><i> Visit to the ashram Gandhipuri was really memorable. It was hearttouching and great to see that in today"s world </i><i>far away from India people still appreciate , respect &amp; follow GANDHIGIRI. The yoga and dance performances </i><i>put up by the students of the ashram was commendable.</i></p>
<p><i>All the afternoon activities organised by Divine Explorer, were full of fun . Visits to Ubud cultural village , Baisakhi temple, Bali cultural and </i><i>spirit festival, Lord Tanna Lot temple ,sunset points, Kechak dance and delicious dinners.</i></p>
<p><i>Guruji &amp; Guruma, being with you we got to see the world in a different and beautiful way. It was a very fulfilling </i><i>experience for our families. It was like being in some other world with you both , cleaning ourselves ,removing </i><i>our coloured glasses ,seeing this beautiful world and its creation as it is . The </i><b><i>Magic </i></b><i>happened because of both </i><i>of your presence. My humble gratitude to both of you.</i></p>
<p><i>Gratitude to Divine Explorer and all the participants from all over the world, who have now become my extended </i><i>Family.</i><strong><i> Hope this magic keeps happening again and again and I  become a part of this magic always.</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Humble Pranams,</i></p>
