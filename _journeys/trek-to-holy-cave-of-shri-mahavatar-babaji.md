Places Covered

This divine journey takes us  trekking amidst the beautiful Kumaon mountains in Doonagiri, Uttarakhand to the very place where the secrets of Kriya Yoga were originally revealed to the modern world by Shri Mahavatar Babaji. This is the very spot where Babaji initiated Shri Lahiri Mahasaya in Kriya Yoga. We will trek to the holy cave of Shri Mahavatar Babaji to meditate there and absorb those spiritual vibes.  We will learn &quot;Vaishwanara Vidya - Secrets of Cosmic Being&quot;  in a surrounding which is comfortable, minimalistic yet authentically rich in natural beauty and  heritage. There is a very &#39;thin distance&#39; between heaven and earth at this very special place.

 Nainital

Nanital is known as the ‘Lake District” of Uttrakhand. Here, the Naini Lake, ringed around by beautiful hills is believed to be one of the 64 Shakti Peeths (energy spots). Mythology says that  parts of the charred body of Sati’s (the embodiment of female Shakti/energy)  fell on earth while being carried by Lord Shiva. The spot where Sati eyes (or Nain) fell, came to be called Nain-tal or lake of the eye. In the Naina Devi Temple located near the lake, Goddess Shakti is worshiped.

Dwarhat

Is there a place where the distance between heaven and earth shrinks?  Literally translated - ‘Dwar’ means gateway and ‘hat’ means heaven - thus Dwarhat can also be called ‘gateway to heaven’, where one feels the heaven on earth. Dwarhat is also the home of many sages, ashrams, temples of great spiritual importance, no wonder it recognized as one of the energy centres.

 

Dunagiri is an area in Kumaon, in an incredibly beautiful setting within themagnificent Himalayas. Dunagiri is also known as the birthplace of modern day Kriya Yoga. It is at Dunagiri in 1861 that the divine current of Kriya Yoga was revealed by Mahavatar Babaji to Shyamacharan Lahiri. It is at Dunagiri that Mahavatar Babaji is said to have given initiation to Haidakhan Baba in Manas yoga, to Neem Karoli Baba in Mantra yoga .It is believed that  the area of Dunagiri is still blessed by the energizing vibrations of Babaji. So strong are the divine vibrations here that one feels very closely connected to god and is able to perceive something of heaven itself.  A visit to the Dunagiri Mata Temple is a must for any spiritual seeker. The Goddess at Dunagiri is the Goddess of yogis, she grants nothing but liberation! One will experience tangible vibrations during the  visits to the ashrams of Haidakhan Baba and Neem Karoli Baba. Sharing of spiritual stories and meditations at these evolved locations will rejuvenate spiritual seekers.
