journey-description:
- Vaishwanara Vidya - Secrets of cosmic being.Many of us are sincerely trying to meditate but the practices we do bring neither prosperity and     nor peace or fulfillment. Sometimes as we start meditating, our life        becomes dry and gives happiness only in certain areas of life. If we        get wealth, we do not get peace of mind; and if we get name and fame,   we do not get harmonious relationships. Real right kind of meditation       should lead one to a complete fulfillment and a prosperous vibrant          blissful life! Should it not? But instead of meditating on the Whole we     actually are meditating on the partial and taking partial only as a     Whole because we simply cannot comprehend Whole! And that is the real       catch!

<p>This divine journey takes us  trekking amidst the beautiful Kumaon mountains in Doonagiri<!--more-->, Uttarakhand  to the very place where the secrets of Kriya Yoga were originally revealed to the modern world by Shri Mahavatar Babaji.This is the very spot where babaji initiated Shri Lahiri Mahasaya in Kriya Yoga. We will trek to the holy cave of Shri Mahavatar Babaji to meditate there and absorb those spiritual vibes.  We will learn "Vaishwanara Vidya - Secrets of Cosmic Being" from Guruji Prem Nirmal, in a surrounding which is comfortable, minimalistic yet authentically rich in natural beauty and  heritage. There is a very 'thin distance' between heaven and earth at this very special place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nainital</b></p>
<p>Nanital is known as the ‘Lake District” of Uttrakhand, here, the Naini Lake, ringed around by beautiful hills is believed one of the 64 Shakti Peeths ( energy spots). Mythology says that  parts of the charred body of Sati’s (the embodiment of female Shakti/energy)  fell on earth while being carried by Lord Shiva. The spot where Sati's eyes (or Nain) fell, came to be called Nain-tal or lake of the eye. The Naina Devi Temple located near the lake the goddess Shakti is worshiped.</p>
<p><b>Dwarahat </b></p>
<p>Is there a place where the distance between heaven and earth shrinks?  Literally translated - ‘<i>Dwar’</i> means gateway and ‘<i>hat’</i> means heaven - thus Dwarhat can also be called ‘gateway to heaven’, where the one feels the heaven on earth. Dwarhat is also the home of many sages, ashrams, temples of great spiritual importance, no wonder it's is recognized as one of the energy centres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Dunagiri </b>is an area in<a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Kumaon"> Kumaon</a>, in an incredibly beautiful setting within the magnificent Himalayas. Dunagiri is also known as the birthplace of modern day Kriya Yoga. It is at Dunagiri in 1861 that the divine current of Kriya Yoga was revealed by Mahavatar Babaji to Shyamacharan Lahiri. It is at Dunagiri that Mahavatar Babaji is said to have given initiation to <b>Haidakhan Baba </b>in Manas yoga, to <b>Neem Karoli Baba</b> in Mantra yoga .</p>
<p>It is believed that  the area of Dunagiri is still blessed by the energizing vibrations  of <b>Babaji</b>. So strong are the divine vibrations here that one feels very closely connected to god and is able to perceive something of heaven itself.  A visit to the Dunagiri Mata Temple is a must for any spiritual seeker, The Goddess at Dunagiri is the Goddess of yogis, she grants nothing but liberation! One will experience tangible vibrations during the  visits to the ashrams of Haidkhan Baba and Neem Karoli Baba. Sharing of spiritual stories and meditations at these evolved locations will rejuvenate spiritual seekers.  </p>

<p><b>Kausani</b></p>
<p>There are very few places in the Himalayas that can compare with the beauty of Kausani - a picturesque hill station famous for its scenic splendour and its spectacular 300 km-wide panoramic view of Himalayan peaks like Trisul, Nanda Devi and Panchchuli. Kausani lies atop a ridge at an altitude of around 1890 m amidst dense pine trees overlooking Someshwar valley on one side and Garur and Baijnath Katyuri valley on the other on Almora-Bageshwar-Didihat Highway.</p>
